# Pomodoro-Productivity-App
Pomodoro, is a countdown timer to help with timing of your study sessions with breaks in between.
At startup the initial values are set in the Settings of 30 minute for Pomodoro, 5 miniute for Short Break and 10 minutes for Long Break
You can change the timings in the Settings accessible via the Gear Icon Button
As well you can set a different color scheme and font selection in the Settings
Timer is initiated via the Start button, Pauses via the pause button as well as you can abort the timer in progress by pressing the clear button,
which will ask you to confirm the choice via a pop-up window.
When either of the timers runs out a Ting Sound is played.

VERSION 0.1
In the current version you have to mannualy set the Pomodoro and Break lengths in the Settings and when the timer runs out and you hear a Ting Sound,
you have to manually select the Short or Long Break and then press the Start Button. In the next version I am planning to add the Break auto start 
capability.
The progress bar is counting out each second. In the next version, I will make a variation of the bar displaying 
total time elapsed/remaining until the finish.
